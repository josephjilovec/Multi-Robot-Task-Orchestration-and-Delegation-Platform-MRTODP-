MRTODP Architecture
Overview
The Multi-Robot Task Orchestration and Delegation Platform (MRTODP) is a modular, scalable framework designed to orchestrate and delegate tasks across heterogeneous robotic systems. It integrates AI-driven task orchestration, a skills marketplace for robot capabilities, and robust robot interfaces, with a user-friendly React frontend. The architecture targets advanced users, such as robotics engineers and AI developers, enabling efficient task management in production environments. This document describes the system's components, their interactions, and data flows, referencing key implementation files and using Mermaid diagrams for clarity.
System Components
MRTODP comprises four primary components:

AI-Driven Task Orchestrator: Combines C++ for performance-critical task management and Python for AI-based task suitability prediction.
Skills Marketplace: Uses Scala and Elixir to manage and distribute robot skills.
Robot Interfaces: Supports ROS and robot-specific languages (e.g., KUKA KRL, Zig) for task execution.
React Frontend: Provides an intuitive UI for task management and skill browsing.

1. AI-Driven Task Orchestrator
The orchestrator handles task decomposition, prioritization, and assignment, leveraging C++ for low-latency scheduling and Python for machine learning (ML) predictions.

C++ Task Manager (backend/cpp/task_manager/orchestrator.cpp):

Manages task queues and delegates tasks to robots based on capabilities.
Uses SQLite for task persistence and ROS for real-time robot communication.
Implements concurrent task scheduling with priority-based queues.
Key Functions:
delegateTask: Assigns tasks to robots, validating capabilities via SQLite (backend/cpp/task_manager/orchestrator.hpp).
matchRobotToTask: Matches tasks to robots based on capability queries.




Python AI Engine (backend/python/ai_engine/delegator.py):

Employs TensorFlow for task suitability prediction using neural networks.
Interfaces with the C++ orchestrator via gRPC for task assignment.
Key Functions:
predict_task_suitability: Generates suitability scores for robots based on task parameters.
assign_robot: Selects the optimal robot using ML predictions and delegates via gRPC.




Julia Neural Network (backend/julia/neural/network.jl):

Implements neural network creation and training with Flux.jl for enhanced task suitability predictions.
Supports GPU acceleration via CUDA.jl and TensorRT for inference.
Key Functions:
NeuralNetwork: Constructs a neural network for task suitability.
train_network!: Trains the model with task data.
infer_network: Performs inference for task assignment.




Common Lisp Planner (backend/lisp/planner.lisp):

Decomposes complex tasks into subtasks and generates symbolic instructions.
Interfaces with SQLite for task storage and Python delegator for subtask assignment.
Key Functions:
decompose-task: Breaks tasks into subtasks (e.g., weld_component into move_to_position and weld).
generate-instructions: Assigns subtasks to robots with symbolic instructions.





2. Skills Marketplace
The skills marketplace enables users to browse, upload, and download robot skills, supporting a wide range of robot types (e.g., KUKA, ABB).

Scala API (backend/scala/src/main/scala/api.scala):

Provides RESTful endpoints for skill management, integrated with Akka HTTP.
Stores skills in a PostgreSQL database, ensuring scalability and reliability.
Key Endpoints:
GET /api/skills: Retrieves available skills.
POST /api/skills: Uploads new skills.
GET /api/skills/:id: Downloads a specific skill.




Elixir Server (backend/elixir/marketplace/server.ex):

Complements Scala with Phoenix-based API endpoints for real-time skill updates.
Uses Ecto for database interactions and WebSocket for live notifications.
Key Endpoints:
GET /api/skills/usage: Provides skill usage statistics.
POST /api/skills: Validates and stores skills.





3. Robot Interfaces
Robot interfaces connect the orchestrator to physical robots, supporting ROS and robot-specific languages.

ROS Integration (backend/cpp/task_manager/orchestrator.cpp):

Communicates with robots via ROS topics and services for task execution.
Supports real-time control and feedback for robots like KUKA and ABB.
Key Functions:
executeTask: Sends tasks to robots via ROS services.




Robot-Specific Languages:

Zig Drivers (backend/zig/drivers/driver.zig): Executes low-level tasks for robots with Zigâ€™s performance-critical code.
Ada Safety (backend/ada/safety/safety.adb): Ensures safe task execution with formal verification.
Robot Languages (e.g., KUKA KRL, ABB Rapid): Supports skill execution for specific robot types.



4. React Frontend
The frontend provides a user interface for task management and skill browsing, built with React 18.

Components:

frontend/src/components/TaskManager.js: Manages task creation, prioritization, and monitoring.
frontend/src/components/Marketplace.js: Allows skill browsing, uploading, and downloading with Chart.js visualizations.
frontend/src/components/Navbar.js: Provides navigation between task management and marketplace.
frontend/src/App.js: Defines routing with React Router.
frontend/src/index.js: Entry point for rendering.
frontend/src/styles/tailwind.css: Custom Tailwind CSS for robot-themed styling.


Key Features:

Task creation and monitoring via REST API calls to Scala/Elixir backends.
Skill marketplace with visualizations of usage statistics.
Responsive design with Tailwind CSS for accessibility across devices.

Data Flow

Task Creation:

Users create tasks via TaskManager.js, sending requests to api.scala or server.ex.
Tasks are stored in PostgreSQL (D) and forwarded to delegator.py via gRPC.


Task Decomposition and Prediction:

planner.lisp decomposes tasks into subtasks, storing them in SQLite (G).
delegator.py uses network.jl to predict robot suitability, leveraging Flux.jl and mocked CUDA/TensorRT.


Task Scheduling and Delegation:

scheduler.rs prioritizes tasks using a concurrent queue and assigns them via delegator.py.
orchestrator.cpp delegates tasks to robots via ROS, validating capabilities with SQLite.


Skill Management:

Users browse/upload skills via Marketplace.js, interacting with api.scala and server.ex.
Skills are stored in PostgreSQL and visualized using Chart.js.


Task Execution:

Robots execute tasks via driver.zig or robot-specific languages, with safety checks in safety.adb.
Execution feedback is relayed back through ROS to orchestrator.cpp.
